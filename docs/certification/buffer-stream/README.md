# Buffer and Streams

Streams is a key feature of NodeJS. Streams provide a mechanism to sequentially read input and write output in chunks.
They are often used in big data applications or media streaming services, where the data is too large to consume at once.

There are four types of streams:
- **Readable streams**
- **Writable streams**
- **Duplex Streams**
- **Transform Stream**

## Creating streams

Stream API is provided by the `stream` core module.
